Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

My client was Artemis Financial and their primary concern was securing sensitive financial data through an effective encryption. The goal for this company was to address data confidentiality within their software infrastructure by adopting robust encryption standards.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

For Artemis Financial, I conducted a thorough analysis to identify software security vulnerabilities, using a mix of tools and manual checks and prioritizing risks based on severity. Clear communication of findings helped stakeholders understand potential risks and mitigation strategies. Secure coding is vital to safeguard sensitive data, maintain customer trust, comply with regulations, and prevent financial losses. The overall value of software security for a company lies in protecting its reputation, ensuring uninterrupted operations, meeting market expectations, and achieving long-term cost savings by proactively addressing vulnerabilities during development.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assesment was conducting a thorough analysis, it required a lot of examination to which I was not use too, however as I further progressed, examining became a lot easier for me. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security I recommended adding advanced encryption standard (AES) to add an extra layer of protection to sensitive data. In the future I would still add AES as it is important to keep senstive data together, however I would also collaborate with cybersecurity experts to get insights on possible threats and be proactive towards penetration testing to identify emerging vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

In order to make certain the code and software application were functional and secure I made sure to do testing and I conducted rigorous testing encompassing unit tests, integration tests, and security testing using both automated tools and manual reviews. I used the maven dependancy reports to expose those possible vulnerabilities or if their were new ones. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I was able to use many resouces, of the course the ones my instructor listed as well as outside resources like youtube, google, tutor center, or whatever I could find that was useful to me. I feel I always use these resouces and will continue too in the future. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would like to showcase my project two where I recommended a alorithm cipher as well as show cased that I can make a certificate and use it functionally.
